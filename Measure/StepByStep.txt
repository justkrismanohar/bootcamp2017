Measure

The two main functions in this project are:

1. enc_tgt(1,1,num_rev). This is used to control the rotation of the wheel.
The first two paramenters are either 1 or 0 (i.e., use or do not use the left
right motors). The third parameter specifies how much to turn the wheel by.
If num_rev = 18, the wheel makes a complete turn.

2. us_dist(15). This returns the value from the ultra sonic sensor.

The main idea is to use enc_tgt to control the movements. So if we are measureing
the side of an ojbect, we can keep truning the wheel a fixed amount until we
reach the end of the side. At the end we know how many turns were made and 
hence we can approximate the distance. 


Step 1
Get familiar with the enc_tgt function by making simple calls and experimentaiton.

Step 2
Experiment with the us_dist calls. Specifically, interpret the us_dist values.
For example, if there is change in values this means something is nearer.
Therefore change form high to low could mean the start of an edge, and change 
form low to high could another edege. 

Step 3
Write some simple loops using enc_tgt and us_dist. For example while us_dist 
is greater than say 35, move forward. Stop when it returns less than 35. 

Step 4
Write functions that use loops in Step 3.

Step 5
Let them experiment to put Steps 1-4 together to measure the side of an object.

Step 6
The enc_tgt(1,1,num_rev) can be used to control rotations in a similar way.
After calling enc_tgt, call left_rot() of right_rot()

Step 7
If necessary neaten up code i.e., function calls, static variables etc.

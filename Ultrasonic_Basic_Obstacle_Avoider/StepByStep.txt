The main idea: interact with the ultra sonic sensor

Step 1.
Experiment with fwd, bwd and stop commands

Step 2. 
Experiment with us_dist(15) calls

Step 3. 
Figure out how to determine when an obstacle is near

Step 4.
Implement Step 3 with a while loop. Stop when Bob meets
an obstacle

Step 5.
Experiment with the servo(degrees) function. 

Step 6.
Figure out how determine a safe direction to move in after 
an obstacle is detected 

Step 7.
Implement Step 6 in a while loop

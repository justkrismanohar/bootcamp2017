The main idea: Use external modules to react to ultra sonic input

Step 1.
Experiment with reading data form the ultra sonic sensor

Step 2. 
Write wrapper function for reading data from the ultra sonic senor

Step 3.
Experiment with the espeak and music modules. 

Step 4.
Figure out how to detect an intruder

Step 5.
Implement Step 3 (can use a simple print function to react to intruder)

Step 6. 
Implement more elaborate reactions. Students and use their own audio files.

Step 7. 
Add a loop so the guard bot returns  to “guard” mode after reacting to an intruder

Step 8. 
Explain how modules work. Can demonstrate with the code from the music module.

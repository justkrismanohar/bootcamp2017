Mary Had a Robo Lamb

The main idea of this project was to intorduce the idea of states, and transitioning 
between them. The lamb as three states: Looking for Mary, Found Mary, and Cry
(lost mary for too long). Students should determine how the current state is affected 
if the lamb detects mary or looses mary.

Step 1. 
Experiment with the us_dist call to figure out how to determine if the lamb 'sees' Mary

Step 2.
Figure out transitions for two states: Looking for Mary and Found Mary, how the state is
affected if the lamb detects mary or looses mary. 

Step 3.
Program Step 2 with a simple while loop.

Step 4. 
Introduce how to measure time. This adds a third transition i.e., if x seconds had passed
in the lost mary state. Figure out how this affects the program in Step 3

Step 5. 
Update the program in Step 3 to use the new transistion i.e., if x seconds had passed
in the lost mary state.
